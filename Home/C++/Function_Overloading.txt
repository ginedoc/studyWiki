Created Monday 25 April 2016

* several unction of the same name
	as long as having different **signatures**.

* compiler use number, types , order of argument to choose the best fit function.

* used to perform some similar function of the same name but different data types.

* Remember: if the return type of two or more overloading functions is different , it is seemed to be compile error.
