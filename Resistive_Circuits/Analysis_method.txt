====== Analysis method ======
Created Thursday 21 April 2016

* Node-Voltage Analysis
	* General solution
	* Supernode
			get the equation for the supernode, (get the relationship of two node)
	* With Dependent source
		1. select reference node
		2. applied KCL -> KVL
		3. solve it !

* Mesh Current Analysis
		1.for all mesh , suppose current for each one 
		2.applied KCL KVL
		 
* Thevenin / Node Equivalent
		for a open source , find its 
						
						R , V , I
						
											to rewrite the equivalent circuit
											
* Superposition principle
		
		for each Indepent source response -> zero other source
